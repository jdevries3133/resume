            The song maker gallery is a website that I made for music teachers
            in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It allows teachers to easily
            create a unique display to present student compositions from the
            <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Music Lab.</a>

            The backend is built with Django and the Django-Rest-Framework. The frontend
            is built with React JS. The use of React allowed me to make a responsive
            and easy-to-use form where teachers can upload .CSV data in order to
            create their galleries. Django facilitated the fast production of a secure backend;
            including the use of Django-Knox which extends the built in Django user
            model to JSON-web-token authentication use cases; such as in my REST API
            & single page application architecture.

            One of the greatest challenges I faced in this project was that
            the site had to capture and store thumbnails of students' work. I
            decided that this would best be accomplished through a microservice
            architecture, by separating the screenshoting mechanism from the
            client-serving backend. I was able to capture the screenshots
            using selenium, and to crop and compress the images using the Python Pillow module.
            I then stored the images in an S3 bucket. Once the "Screenshot Bot"
            captured and uploaded the screenshots to S3, it sent a patch request
            back to the client-facing server where the gallery model was updated
            with thumbnails that provided users with an accurate preview of student work.

        <p>
            Having started my front end journey with React JS, this website demonstrates
            my skills in "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The ability to build a web
            page with these classic web technologies is absolutely critical for  fast page loading timee, search
            engine optimization, and a good user experience; I hope that this site, which I wrote from scratch,
            demonstrates basic competency in these technologies.
